NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::DiagINC - Add Test::DiagINC to all .t files

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        # in dist.ini
        [Test::DiagINC]

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin adds the following Test::DiagINC line to all
    ".t" files under the "t/" directory:

        use if $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}, 'Test::DiagINC';

    It will be inserted before the first module loaded, excluding "strict"
    and "warnings". This makes sure that it is loaded before Test::More,
    which Test::DiagINC requires.

    For example, it will turn this:

        use 5.008001;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::More;
        # etc.

    Into this:

        use 5.008001;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use if $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}, 'Test::DiagINC';
        use Test::More;
        # etc.

RATIONALE
    Prerequisite reporting modules like
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportPrereqs and similar modules give an
    overview of prerequisites, but don't generally list *deep* dependencies
    â€” i.e. the modules used by the modules you use.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PrereqsFromMeta offers a feature to report
    from %INC after loading all prerequisites, but it doesn't cover all
    types of dependencies and can't account for optional dependencies.

    What I find most relevant is knowing exactly what modules are loaded
    when any given test fails. This would include test modules, optional
    modules and so on. It is *specific* to the failure situation.

    That sort of output is also verbose, so this plugin only generates that
    output if $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} is true. That means it will show up on
    CPAN Testers, but not clutter up manual test output, which seems to me
    like the right trade-off.
